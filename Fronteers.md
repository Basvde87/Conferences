# FronteersConf 2017
Here are my notes of the 10th conference of Fronteers. It's the 5th conference i was attending. 
It was a good conference with inspiring talks, from Emoji to CSS Animation and from Imposter syndrome to WebVR.

## Day 1
### Don't Panic - Niels Leenheer
After a memorylane trough the years of the web! 
From the 90's, who brought him a revolution, the web made new things and worlds possible.

> We, normal people, we changed the world! It's a revolution of people.

Browsers are everywere. But compared to years ago, now browsers are compatible. Almost... 10 years ago... IE7, IE6, wtf.

Developer tools came, and now we got frameworks. Which made browsers a serious environment to develop apps. 
Shows a carousel of the names (some were invented :)). React is new, but already 4 years old.

Remember that browsers already have a framework built in, don't forget and don't be afraid to use the web platform.

Features that were added over the last 10 years.

- DOM, shadow dom, etc.
- New elements
- Video included
- Audio playback and generation, speech recognition
- Responsive img,
- Web animations, web DB, storage
- Networking, peer to peer
- Devices support, gamepads etc., bluetooth
- Offline support
- JS lots
- CSS gradients, transforms, transaniations, fonts, mq, selectors, etc.

> We're no longer web developers, we need to specialize. Don't develop for browsers, develop for the web!


### Impostor Syndrome and Individual Competence - Jessica Rose
"What am i doing here, is is the right thing to do. I'm not good at this, i doesn't belong here!" That is what are brain is doing to us.
Our brains are terrible at self-assessment. This can be very demotivating. 
> Your brain uses bad data to build worse conclusions that it becomes really attached to: enter impostor syndrome.

If you're getting messages that you're not in a space that belongs to you, you internalize those.

What is technology doing to impostor syndrome? Social media can make it worse. Technology invites us to compare our real lives to someone else's Best Of Hits.

How can we make it better for others?

Never tell anyone else they have impostor syndrome. Don't override someone's concerns with just "oh, it's just impostor syndrome".
Give positive meaningful and actionable feedback.
Talk about your own feelings and fears when you feel comfortable doing so.
Fixing it for yourself:

Take on positive feedback and accurately assess yourself: you can outsource the latter (tests, teaching, write articles).
Interrupt the "oh god they're going to find out" process. Check in with yourself periodically. Take care of yourself and do the thing that chills you out.
Keep track of what you learn over time, and look back periodically.
What if impostor syndrome is just your brain telling you in a terrible way that you're actually doing fine?
